# KallistiOS Toolchain Builder (`kos-chain`) with MinGW-w64/MSYS2 #

This document contains all the instructions to create a fully working
toolchain targeting the **Sega Dreamcast** system under **MinGW-w64/MSYS2**.

This document applies only on the newer **MinGW-w64/MSYS2** environment provided
by [MinGW-w64.org](https://mingw-w64.org/). For the legacy **MinGW/MSYS**
environment, check the [`mingw.md`](mingw.md) file.

## Introduction ##

On **MinGW-w64/MSYS2** system, the package manager is the `pacman` tool.
All preliminary operations will be done through this tool.

The **MinGW-w64/MSYS2** environment exists in several different flavors.
Everything has been tested using the **Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime**,
also known as `MSVCRT`. The newer **UCRT (Universal C Runtime)** hasn't
been tested. `MSVCRT` packages are accessible using the `mingw-w64`
prefix, as shown below in the document.

We are now using **64-bit** packages, but `MSVCRT` packages also exists
in **32-bit**. For this reason, the `${arch}` keyword will be used in
the document. As soon as you see this `${arch}` keyword, you will have to
replace it:

- **32-bit**: `i686`
- **64-bit**: `x86_64`

For example, if you see `mingw-w64-${arch}-toolchain` and you are working
with **64-bit** packages, you will have to read as: `mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain`.

Please note also, all versions prior to **Windows 10** were dropped on this
environment. If you need support for older OS, you need to use the
**MinGW/MSYS** environment instead.

## Installation of MinGW-w64/MSYS2 ##

1. Open your browser to [**MinGW-w64.org**](https://mingw-w64.org/) and choose
   the [download **MSYS2** distribution](http://www.msys2.org/). Download the
   installer file `msys2-${arch}-${date}.exe` (e.g.`msys2-x86_64-20241208.exe`)
   from the [**MSYS2** repository](http://www.msys2.org/).

2. Run `msys2-${arch}-${date}.exe` then click on the `Next` button. In the
   `Installation Directory` text box, input `C:\dcsdk\` or something else, but
   the directory don't accept spaces. The `Installation Directory` will be
   called `${MINGW_ROOT}` later in the document. Click on the `Next` button
   to continue.

3. Click on the `Next` button again, then click on the `Finish` button to start
   the **MSYS2 Shell**.

The **MinGW-w64/MSYS2** base environment is now ready. It's time to setup the
environment to build the Dreamcast toolchains.

### Update of your local installation ###

The first thing to do after installing is to update your local installation:
```
pacman -Syuu
```
At the end of the process, a similar message to this one should be appear:
```
warning: terminate MSYS2 without returning to shell and check for updates again
warning: for example close your terminal window instead of calling exit
```
This just means the `pacman` runtime has been updated. Close the terminal as
requested. Restart the **MSYS2 Shell** and run the same command again:
```
pacman -Syuu
```
This should update all the packages of the **MinGW-w64/MSYS2** environment.

### Installation of required packages ###

The packages below need to be installed to build the toolchains, so open the
**MSYS2 Shell** and input:
```
pacman -Sy --needed base-devel patch diffutils mingw-w64-${arch}-toolchain mingw-w64-${arch}-autotools mingw-w64-${arch}-texinfo mingw-w64-${arch}-libpng mingw-w64-${arch}-libjpeg-turbo mingw-w64-${arch}-libelf mingw-w64-${arch}-freetype mingw-w64-${arch}-freeglut
```
### Installation of additional packages ###

Additional packages are needed, if you don't have them installed in your
system already:
```
pacman -Sy git python
```
**Git** is needed right now, as **Python** will be needed only when building `kos-ports`,
but it's better to install these now.

By the way you can check the installation success by entering something like
`git --version`. This should returns something like `git version X.Y.Z`.
Same applies for **Python**, using `python --version`.

## Preparing the environment installation ##

1. Open the **MSYS2 Shell** by double-clicking the shortcut on your start menu
   (or alternatively, double-click on the `${MINGW_ROOT}\mingw${arch}.exe` file,
   e.g. `${MINGW_ROOT}\mingw64.exe`).

2. Enter the following to prepare **KallistiOS**:

		mkdir -p /opt/toolchains/dc/
		cd /opt/toolchains/dc/
		git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/cadcdev/kallistios kos
		git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/cadcdev/kos-ports

Everything is ready, now it's time to make the toolchains.

## Compilation ##

The **kos-chain** system may be customized by setting up a
`Makefile.cfg` file in the root of the `kos-chain` directory tree. If this is
desired, read the main [`README`](/utils/kos-chain/README.md) for more information on
setting up custom options for the toolchain; however, in most circumstances,
the stable defaults already present in
[`Makefile.dreamcast.cfg`](../../Makefile.dreamcast.cfg) will be fine.

### Building the toolchains ###

To build the toolchain, do the following:

1. Start the **MSYS2 Shell** if not already done.

2. Navigate to the `kos-chain` directory by entering:
	```
	cd /opt/toolchains/dc/kos/utils/kos-chain/
	```

3. (Optional) Copy and alter the `Makefile.cfg` file options to your liking.

4. Enter the following to start downloading and building toolchain:
	```
	make
	```

Now it's time to have a coffee as this process can be long: several minutes to
hours will be needed to build the full toolchain, depending on your system.

### Removing all useless files ###

After everything is done, you can cleanup all temporary files by entering:
```
make distclean
```

## Fixing up Newlib for SH4 ##

The `ln` command in the **MinGW-w64/MSYS2** environment is not effective, as
symbolic links are not well managed under this environment.
That's why you need to manually fix up **SH4** `Newlib` when updating your
toolchains (i.e. rebuilding it) and/or updating **KallistiOS**.

This is the purpose of the provided `fixup-sh4-newlib.sh` script.

Before executing it, edit the file to be sure the `$toolchains_base` variable
is correctly set, then run it by entering:
```
./packages/fixup-sh4-newlib.sh
```

## Next steps ##

After following this guide, the toolchains should be ready.

Now it's time to compile **KallistiOS**.

You may consult the [`README`](../../../../doc/README) file from KallistiOS now.
